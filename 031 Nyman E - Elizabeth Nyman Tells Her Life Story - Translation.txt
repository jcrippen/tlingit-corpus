1	My father was from Telegraph Creek.
2	He was a Khàch.adi,
3	so I am a Child of the Ḵaach.ádi.
4	My mother was a Yanyeidí woman,
5	the daughter of X̱ʼagóokʼ (Dr. Jackson);
6	her name was Kudagáan.
7	While she was pregnant with me,
8	something was wrong with her back—
9	maybe she was born that way—
10	it was broken.
11	So I was born when I was seven months old;
12	I was premature.
13	Then
14	when I was one month old my mother died.
15	After she died
16	my uncle Billie Williams and the others
17	all got together with the chief.
18	Then
19	they were asking one another, “What are we to do with the baby?”
20	For lack of anything else to do, my future father-in-law,
21	Yax̱góosʼ (Billie Williams) said,
22	“Let her be smothered under her mother’s breast
23	and buried with her mother.”
24	Then my true grandmother (Ḵinx̱.ashee, Anna) spoke up,
25	“It will not be so.
26	Whenever she begins to starve on me
27	I will chew up something for her to eat.”
28	“Can you raise her on that?
29	She’ll die of hardship,” [said Billie Williams.]
30	The others did not say a word;
31	it was Yax̱góos’ alone who was speaking.
32	“That’s all right; I don’t care;
33	if she starves on me, then she’ll starve,” she said.
34	So they conceded to her, and she saved me.
{Page = 103}
35	So she adopted me; whoever had children
36	she would pay
37	to nurse me for a day [at a time], they say.
38	People who perhaps had a lot of children,
39	she would pay one or another of them.
40	I wonder how my grandmother figured out how to do all that.
41	She would boil rice
42	until it was just liquid
43	and pour it through cheesecloth.
44	After she had carefully, very carefully,
45	gotten out the rice husks
46	she would spoon in some oil and boil it with it.
47	Then too
48	the type of milk called condensed milk—
49	it tastes really sweet, like sugar—
50	she would spoon in a little bit of that
51	and stir it in.
52	My mother had little spoon, so big,
53	with a twisted handle;
54	this is what she would feed me with
55	when the families with children had gone to the trapping grounds.
56	One time my father went to town.
57	Then
58	Mrs. Pillman asked him, “What are they doing with the baby?”
59	“Her grandmother has adopted her, her true grandmother.”
60	So
61	they showed my father a baby bottle.
62	They fixed it up for him,
63	“Here’s how you do it, like this and this; here’s the equipment,”
64	they told him.
65	So [he got] two apiece, the bottle and the [rest of it];
66	my father bought the whole works.
67	Maybe I was big by then.
68	So he brought them to my grandmother,
69	“Here’s how you do it, like this; here’s the measuring cup,”
70	they told my grandmother.
71	She must have been overjoyed.
72	After they did that they didn’t have to pay anyone else
73	to breast-feed me.
74	Eventually I was weaned
75	and ate [solid] food.
{Page = 105}
76	Finally
77	I was now able to speak and
78	my grandmother rejoiced.
79	So
80	when I was four, they say, my grandmother died.
81	This is as much as I know of her, nothing more.
82	Now
83	was married to the son of Yax̱góosʼ (Billy Williams)
84	When I was married to him I had my first baby;
85	he gave him his elder brother’s name Jigéi,
86	Xóots (Brown Bear),
87	and in English as well he called him Jackie.
88	I had my second one, my daughter Sʼigax̱sháak’w (Mary)
89	at the trapping grounds, at Kax̱noowk’u Tuḵká,
90	at a place called Héen Tlein (Inklen River).
91	At that time, once we were all through eating,
92	my father-in-law brought up the subject [of my birth].
93	His tears were just rolling clown.
94	“You see how foolish I was;
95	if my mother had not insisted [otherwise],
96	they would have done what I said
97	and smothered her under her mother.
98	Who would have taken on my elder brother’s name, so dear to me
99	Jigéi,
100	Xóots,
101	Jackie—
102	who would have brought him back down to us?
103	When I think about it now it makes me feel lonely
104	and I feel like weeping.
105	My sister’s namesake, S’igax̱sháak’w—
106	who would have brought her back down to us?
107	I am so sorry,
108	this is what I am trying to express.
109	Truly
{Page = 107}
110	it was on my mind;
111	this is why I am confessing to you
112	what I might have done to you.
{Comment = Line 113 is two lines but numbering skips a line so we unify them.}
113	And now I am encouraged [because of] my elder brother’s namesake and my sister’s namesake.
114	‘Thank you so much,’ I say to my mother.
115	I have missed my elder brother and sister so much,
116	and now they have corne back down.
117	I am truly happy,”
118	he said.
119	I guess in English you would say he “confessed.”
120	To this day I don’t blame him;
121	it’s just the way our culture used to be,
122	what he told them to do with me.
123	Now I always think,
124	“I wish you could see all your grandchildren’s children,”
125	They are all grown up, including Mary’s children;
126	so many of them have children.
127	And those of his mother's namesake, Ḵinx̱.ashee (Anna Kirby),
128	are as numerous as sand
129	and still having more children in Terrace,
130	my grandchildren.
131	And Jackie’s [children] in Vancouver,
132	I don’t know how many there are,
133	and they are still having more children.
134	I alone
135	am their only living forebear.
136	It is true what my father-in-law said;
137	if they had done what he told them to do
138	we would have been left barren now.
139	Perhaps it is by the power of God
140	that my true grandmother saved me.
141	So now her namesake’s family
142	is growing by leaps and bounds in Terrace.
143	She has I don’t know how many grandchildren.
144	Sometimes
145	I am suspicious of what people say,
146	white women or white men.
147	When my grandmother passed on,
148	at that time
149	I had only one grandfather left.
