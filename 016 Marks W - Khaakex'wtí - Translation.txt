1	Now, I will tell of Ḵaakexʼwtí.
2	This place called G̱athéeni
3	is where people lived, out there along the ocean.
4	On the mainland from Cape Spencer the place is called G̱athéeni.
5	It was this kind of a place ancient people lived in.
6	They used to live there
7	away from
8	war parties; they lived in a safe place.
9	A difficult place; this was how people lived.
10	Seals
11	were killed at night
12	for people to eat.
13	That’s why
14	he went.
15	His paddlers were also with him
16	also the one who sits midship in the canoe.
17	I wonder how the midsection man was related to him, and to the one who paddled.
18	They were anchored
19	where the seals swam by at night.
20	He had a spear.
21	Perhaps they killed sorne.
22	Maybe it was getting light,
{Page = 155}
23	time to return.
24	What was it that kept flying past his face? It bothered him
25	when it flew to his face.
26	When it did this again he waved his paddle.
27	It flew into the paddle.
28	It dropped in the canoe.
29	What did he compare it to? It was grotesque.
30	Then what? Perhaps he threw that thing in the sea,
31	that bird.
32	(I have been reprimanded just recently.)
33	They began paddling to the village.
34	They had just begun to paddle; they had not been going long
35	when his midsection paddler keeled over,
36	the one sitting in the midsection.
37	Maybe when they were nearing their village
38	his stern man
39	keeled over also.
40	People would fall asleep.
41	Maybe people were dying then.
42	That man
43	had clubbed his sleep.
44	When he brought his dead crew to the village
45	perhaps to the beach of the village perhaps he was yelling
46	“What’s happened to my crew?”
47	Why was there no one?
48	He didn’t see a single human
49	at the village.
50	People were sleeping forever.
51	When he went up from the beach,
52	they were gone. They had all died.
53	This happened to the one village.
54	Perhaps he buried these relatives of his.
55	Only then he began walking.
56	Traps
57	were around long ago. He had
58	those things called traps.
{Page = 157}
59	Probably
60	he also had some of those things
61	he might hunt with.
62	Which way did he go? Maybe he came down
63	behind Mt. Fairweather.
64	He walked.
65	Faaaaaaaaar!
66	Probably many many months passed during his walk.
67	That’s when he came on them,
68	those things,
69	a man’s footprints
70	along a river bank.
71	What are these little dead falls
72	doing here, sitting there in the water?
73	They were placed close to one other.
74	Inside the farthest one
75	lay one little hooligan.
76	Some footprints were around them.
77	He knew that hooligans were being trapped.
78	(If you trap one, how many will it feed?)
79	He knew he had come on humans.
80	That’s why he made it,
81	the thing they make in our land,
82	those things used to catch hooligans,
83	the thing that is used to kill them.
84	He wove
85	the one that is called
86	a trap, indeed.
87	That’s when
88	he hooked it down
89	out there in the river.
90	When he thought it was very full
91	he waded out there.
92	It was full.
93	Then he dumped them by the traps.
94	Again by the ones beyond them he’d dump some.
95	Until the traps disappeared
96	that’s how he did it
{Page = 159}
97	When day was breaking
98	he heard people’s voices.
99	He ran away from there to hide.
100	Weh-weh-weh-weh-weh.
101	People were corning out.
102	He saw
103	the Athabaskans.
104	They could see his footprints.
105	It was easy to see they were trying to talk to him; it was easy to see.
106	No!
107	He didn’t show himself.
108	They left again.
109	Perhaps for long; perhaps for just one night.
110	That’s when he heard people’s voices again.
111	They were coming again,
112	they knew a human was there; one had come.
113	How many the hooligans were; there was a lot of food,
114	the hooligans he dumped there.
115	Because they wanted to show their gratitude to him
116	they called him.
117	Wasn’t that a woman they had brought along?
118	It was a woman for him.
119	Perhaps they tried to talk to him.
120	Perhaps they pointed her out to him.
121	“Here is a wife tor you,” they said.
122	Only then did he finally come out of the forest.
123	They motioned to him in sign language
124	“She’s all yours.”
125	He left to go home with them.
126	That’s how he remained there; for how many years did he live among them?
127	Then there were children,
128	his children.
129	All of a sudden –
130	(but I forgot what he would say.)
131	They were already fully grown,
132	perhaps over sixteen
133	fifteen years; that’s what Tlingits call
{Page = 161}
134	already fully grown.
135	I guess he wanted to go back.
136	Why not try along the shore line?
137	(I told it wrong.)
138	First he left there
139	alone
140	toward the way back.
141	He knew how he had come along the shore line through the forest
142	from behind the mountain.
143	That’s why he knew how he would go along the beach.
144	F-a-r-r-r-r-r! How long he walked.
145	Lituya Bay.
146	Perhaps he made a raft to cross it.
147	On the near side of it
148	this south side of it
149	is what is called Nagootkʼí.
150	Hey!
151	A Tlingit was coming toward Ḵaakexʼwtí.
152	There is a song for this,
153	the one who was coming toward him,
154	but I don’t know it.
155	His pack was very tall.
156	When he was closer to him he thought he lifted his head.
157	Hey!
158	It was a rock.
159	That’s why it’s called even till today
160	“The Little Walker.”
161	It was given that name then.
162	He went back
163	again.
164	Then perhaps he stayed long at home.
165	Perhaps a month went by.
166	Maybe here he collected those coppers
167	he came upon,
168	whatever else with them
169	all his children could pack.
{Page = 163}
170	When they were ready
171	they began walking
172	along the beach.
173	They walked.
174	Maybe they came up there toward the head of Dixon Harbor.
175	But where were they?
176	People had just left.
177	The wood was still embers.
178	That was the settiement they came on
179	also a settlement.
180	The Chookaneidí lived uppermost in the bay.
181	Next to them lived the Kaagwaantaan.
182	The Kaagwaantaan had a shaman.
183	He was the one who would predict when he sang.
184	He would compare it to Tlʼanaxéedaḵw.
185	That is how he looked to him.
186	Tlʼanaxéedaḵw originated from Auke Bay.
187	It looked to him like her ghost; well, whoever saw
188	Tlʼanaxéedaḵw would become rich.
189	This is how those shaman spirits would sing.
190	The coming of Tlʼanaxéedaḵw.
191	He told his men, “Be brave.”
192	All of a sudden people came out there.
193	People were across the river.
194	People were talking there; they were speaking their language.
195	Maybe it was a “hard case”
196	Chookaneidí who ran out there.
197	“They’re down the bay!
198	They’re down the bay! The people who were cutting tongues to get you,
199	you little land otter people,”
200	is what he said.
201	He claimed they were land otter people.
202	So Ḵaakexʼwtí told his children,
203	“They’re telling us to go down the bay.”
{Page = 165}
204	That’s why there's a proverb
205	about “sending Athabaskans down the opposite bay.”
206	It was a Chookaneidí who did that.
207	The shaman was already there,
208	the Kaagwaantaan shaman.
209	That’s when
210	they to1d him
211	“There are some people across the bay.”
212	The shaman immediately to1d them
213	“They are the ones,
214	they are the ones.”
215	Then the people ran out to them.
216	“Hey! They have coppers!”
217	That is when
218	he told what happened to him.
219	Maybe that’s when
220	he tried by boat.
221	Boats went
222	to the Copper River.
223	That is where copper was acquired.
224	But only for the rich peop1e.
225	It was brought here for the rich people.
