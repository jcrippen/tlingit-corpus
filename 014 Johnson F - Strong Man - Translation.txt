1	It is
2	called
3	Henyaa; people used to live there.
4	It was a winter village.
5	But I didn’t
6	understand altogether why
7	people trained for strength.
8	Maybe this is an ancient story which is why
9	there are no guns or no metal.
10	I sometimes think it was the sea lions they wanted to kill for food.
11	There was one man.
12	His name was G̱alwéitʼ.
13	He was the leader of his nation.
14	But his sister’s son was what
15	some people would call being like a misfit. He was awkward.
16	But he was born from good people.
17	Then
18	before daybreak they would go to the sea water.
19	That mother’s brother of his would lead them on. {Comment = Line 20 has ‘happy sound’ which should probably be ‘sound happy’.}
20	Their voices would sound happy when they went to the sea.
21	But because the men didn’t respect him,
22	he went to the sea alone.
23	When people went to sleep he would go to the sea. {Page = 141}
24	( F.J.: Shall I teIl it just the way they tell it?)
25	( N.D.: Uh huh.)
26	He would sit in the water until it overpowered him.
27	When he came up
28	the fire would be out.
29	But where the fire had been would be warm.
30	Because he wanted to warm up
31	he would urinate right on where the fire had been.
32	The steam from this would warm him,
33	from where the fire had been.
34	Grime would collect on his body because he slept by the fire.
35	No one paid attention to him.
36	But one of his mother’s brother’s wives would feel sorry for him.
37	She would give him
38	food.
39	But she didn’t want her husband to see her do it.
40	Then after a period of time
41	he would cry out in pain
42	when he sat alone in the water
43	from the cold.
44	It would come out of his mouth.
45	At one point
46	while he was sitting in the water again
47	someone spoke to him from the beach.
48	“Wade over here,” the man said to him.
49	He looked over there.
50	The man wore a black bear skin cape.
51	He wasn’t too tall.
52	Then he said to him,
53	“I’m your good luck.
54	I’m Strength.
55	I’m called Strength.”
56	Then Strength said to him, “Now
57	defeat me.”
58	Then he did as he told him.
59	He didn’t even scratch him.
60	And then
61	Strength said to him,
62	“Stand right there.”
63	Then Strength
64	began to scrub him with yellow seaweed {Page = 143}
65	on his joints,
66	on all his joints. People count them as eight bones.
67	Perhaps they are all the long limbs.
68	On all his joints. So he scrubbed him with yellow seaweed.
69	Then Strength said to him, “Now
70	go into the water again.”
71	He went into the water again. He told him to defeat him again.
72	Without trying, Strength would throw him down.
73	And here again,
74	soon he scrubbed him again the same way.
75	He sent him to the water again.
76	When he did this the fourth time
77	Strength didn’t throw him down.
78	Strength said to him, “You have thrown me down now.
79	That’s enough,”
80	he said to him.
81	As soon as he said that, Strength disappeared.
82	Only patches of frost floated where Strength had stood in the water.
83	He gained strength all alone.
84	They say
85	there was a thing by which they tested each other.
86	It was a young tree.
87	It stood in the middle of the village, it
88	was called “Village Tree” by those people.
89	And
90	this thing that was like a large branch
91	stuck out at the base of the tree.
92	It was called the Village Nose.
93	It is also called by another name.
94	I’ll tell what it is after this.
95	Strength told him to go to it.
96	“Pull the Village Nose out.
97	Immerse it in water then push it back again.
98	The young tree too–
99	split it from the tip down to the base.
100	He did just as he told him; he began
101	splitting from the top down.
102	He split it down to the roots.
103	Only after this he returned home again.
104	When people awoke, his maternal uncle
