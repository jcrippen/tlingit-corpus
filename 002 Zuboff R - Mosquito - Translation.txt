1	It was
2	in this boat of mine,
3	it was called “Guide,”
4	I would travel around in it,
5	seining.
6	Well,
7	my name
8	in Tlingit
9	is Shaadaaxʼ.
10	It was
11	because of my name
12	Geetwéin called me over.
13	The one of long ago,
14	he died long ago.
15	I was a young man.
16	From the time I was a young man
17	I had a seine boat.
18	I had
19	a nineteen hundred and six model,
20	from when they first came out.
21	I had
22	two of these big boats.
23	The last one
24	I gave to my son.
25	But he wrecked it
{Page = 75}
26	He wrecked the boat,
27	the same one I used to go around in.
28	Then, knowing what my name was,
29	Geetwéin said to me:
30	“I would like very much to explain to you
31	this name of yours.”
32	We were living there
33	in the Interior.
34	Our life there
35	was so hard.
36	The salmon.
37	From the ocean
38	they would come up for us to eat.
39	The salmon.
40	And these how good they tasted to us,
41	the salmon.
42	It was very
43	hard
44	to live in the Interior.
45	It was so hard
46	the people
47	ate each other.
48	There were cannibals
49	at that time.
50	That was
51	what we would tell about
52	when we migrated to the coast.
53	What we would tell about.
54	What we would still tell about.
55	There was
56	this one
57	family whose food
58	was getting scarce.
59	Then one of them
60	went hunting
61	for something he could kill.
62	When he didn’t come back down
63	his younger brother went to search for him.
64	Then he
65	didn’t come back down either.
66	When he didn’t come back down
67	the youngest one,
68	maybe he was seventeen years old,
{Page = 77}
69	maybe eighteen years old,
70	the youngest one,
71	was crying as he kept on searching for his older brothers.
72	Inland between the mountains
73	when he reached there he saw it was the man.
74	He immediately knew
75	it was a cannibal.
76	It was coming toward him. He couldn’t run from it. He was like a frozen thing. It was fear that did this to him.
77	When it came near him it struck him on the head,
78	the cannibal struck him on the head.
79	He fell,
80	he fell there.
81	How good the cannibal felt.
82	It picked him up from there, that young man
83	and put him into a sack
84	into a sack.
85	Then it packed him on its back
86	to its territory
87	to where its house was standing.
88	Outside
89	out by the entrance it removed
90	its pack.
91	The cannibal went inside
92	inside its home.
93	But the young man
94	was inside the pack.
95	He was trying to get out of it.
96	He broke those ties,
97	small strings of spruce roots tying the pack.
98	When he came out
99	he got the cannibal’s club.
100	He waited where it was going to come out.
101	As it stuck its head out, he struck it.
102	He struck it again.
103	He struck it again.
104	He struck it again.
105	He said,
106	“I know I killed this cannibal.
107	But it did a painful thing to me.
108	It killed two of my older brothers.
{Page = 79}
109	What more can I do to make it feel more pain?
110	Maybe it will be better
111	if I build a fire under him, and burn him up.”
112	So just like that
113	when he built a fire,
114	he pulled him into it,
115	he pulled the cannibal
116	into the fire.
117	When only the ashes were left,
118	when he couldn’t make up his mind, he thought,
119	“What more can I do to the cannibal’s ashes?”
120	And while he couldn’t make up his mind, he blew on it,
121	he blew on the cannibal’s ashes.
122	They went into the air,
123	they became mosquitos.
124	That’s why mosquitos
125	when they bite someone,
126	hurt you bad, they’re still the cannibal; even today.
127	When it can’t do this
128	it tries to take all the blood from a person.
129	That’s what happened.
130	The Lord above created
131	this world.
132	He loved us very much,
133	us in this world.
134	Mosquitos
135	were created by the world.
136	That is why
137	there is a story
138	about it, when we were living in Teslin,
139	Teslin.
140	It’s beside the big lake.
141	The place
142	is called
143	Caribou Cross,
144	the place where animals cross.
145	Right near it is called Teslin.
146	There are many people there,
147	we are many.
148	We are still there.
149	They speak our language.
{Page = 81}
150	This is how I’ll end it.
151	And now
152	I will tell stories
153	to the children
154	in English.
