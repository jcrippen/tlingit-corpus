1	The story:
2	the name of this man was Naatsilanéi.
3	He went out by boat with his brothers-in-law
4	outside of Taan.
5	Their village
6	was just outside of Klawock.
7	It was from there they went out by boat to that place.
8	And then
9	they came back
10	without their brother-in-law.
11	What had they done with him?
12	He was at the middle of the island. When they were already way out on the boat
13	he said
14	“Come here and get me, my brothers-in-law.”
15	There was a man from whose lips this is told.
16	This is how we know it.
17	They are our ancestors.
18	This is what we call those who are Tsaagweidi.
19	That man’s name was Naatsilanéi,
20	the other one.
21	He really didn’t know what to do.
22	“What is going to become of me?”
23	These thoughts were on his mind.
{Page = 125}
24	He didn’t know
25	how many nights he spent there.
26	Someone talked to him.
27	He had probably been there a long time on that island.
28	“What happened to you?”
29	That was the voice he looked at.
30	It was a young man,
31	a young man.
32	“They left without me, you know,” Naatsilanéi said.
33	“Well, we watched them, you see,” the young man said.
34	“It’s right out there
35	where they came ashore.
36	Just sit still please,
37	sit still.”
38	Time went fast.
39	He stayed another night.
40	That’s when
41	he came to Naatsilanéi.
42	“Come here!
43	come here!
44	Get inside this thing!
45	Get inside this thing!”
46	He moved it over the waves four times.
47	Finally,
48	on the fourth time,
49	the man told him to get inside.
50	It was a stomach.
51	A large one.
52	He didn’t know.
53	”Please don’t think back to here.
54	Only think about the mainland.
55	There is a sandy beach.”
56	When he was only half way his thought returned.
57	“Come out of there.
58	That’s what I told you.
59	Here, hold this.
60	Please don’t think about here.
61	Hold this.”
{Page = 127}
62	He gave Naatsilanéi that thing.
63	No one knew.
64	But it was known
65	what it was for.
66	“Through this you will will talk to me,
67	through this.”
68	It wasn’t long when he notieed.
69	Hey–it had floated to shore; he could feel it.
70	The man instructed him what he would do with it.
71	He held it trom the inside,
72	from the inside.
73	Then he pulled it out.
74	Through this thing he was given he spoke to the man.
75	“I’m already here!”
76	he said to him.
77	“Well, we can see you.
78	Have courage!
79	You will see more.
80	Whatever you desire
81	just name it.”
82	He talked
83	through this thing.
84	It wasn’t long when
85	these boats were coming toward him.
86	They were coming toward him.
87	“What kind of people were they?”
88	He didn’t know.
89	They were human
90	but he didn’t know them.
91	But they tried to talk.
92	“What happened to you?”
93	“Well, I was brought in from out there.”
94	He wasn’t telling what had happened.
95	“I was brought in from out there.”
96	They didn’t know what had happened.
97	His wives were there,
98	his wives.
99	This is the way things were long ago; he had two wives.
100	They didn’t know.
101	“Why was it?”
102	they would ask about him; they would weep.
{Page = 129}
103	“We don’t know.
104	A wave carried him out from the island.
105	We couldn’t find him.”
106	This is how they told about their brother-in-law.
107	It wasn’t long
108	when that man came to him.
109	“Come here.
110	Do you see that?”
111	I wonder what it was.
112	“That’s your food.
113	That’s your food.
114	It’s over here.”
115	It was his help.
116	It was help.
117	Those beings that fly.
118	Many people know them.
119	The things called Brant.
120	It was human.
121	Human.
122	That’s when
123	Brant pointed them out to him.
124	“That’s your food.
125	Your house is over here.
126	You will go to it.
127	Don’t enter through the door.
128	Your wife will be on the other side.
129	One of them
130	will be brought there.”
131	That’s what he said to him.
132	At one point it was time
133	when the night
134	cornes to a halt.
135	When half of the night
136	was becoming dawn
137	Brant said to him,
138	“Come now.”
139	It didn’t seem far
140	for him to walk.
141	“Here it is,
142	here it is.
143	Do you see that thing?
144	Pick it up!
{Page = 131}
145	Stick it up through there!
146	Your wife is there!
147	It wasn’t but a moment.
148	He took it from Brant.
149	“It’s me,
150	it’s me,” Naatsilanéi said.
151	“Is that you? It’s me,” she said.
152	“What happened to you?”
153	“Well, they went home without me.”
154	His tools
155	have been in existence for a long time,
156	the things people make things with,
157	his adze,
158	and the things he makes things with.
159	She gave them to him through the forest side
160	through the corner,
161	the way the helper instructed him
162	through the forest side
163	in that place where he lived.
164	His food was plentiful
165	from his helper.
166	From then he lived there.
167	It was there.
168	“Let’s look over there,” the others said.
169	They didn’t know where he was living.
170	Yes.
171	They were hunting.
172	Hunters
173	were going by boat.
174	“I will tell you.”
175	It was that being that talked to him, that being that was helping him.
176	“I will tell you.
177	Here,
178	they will come here.
179	There will be five of them in there.
180	Those are the ones.”
181	That is what the helper told him.
182	“Five of them.”
183	It was there he carved
184	the Killer Whales.
185	He carved all kinds of materiais.
186	People don’t tell it the same way.
{Page = 133}
187	He carved bark.
188	He carved red cedar.
189	Different kinds of material; whatever had drifted ashore is what he carved.
190	He’d cut them like Killer Whales.
191	Who was the one that carved them?
192	It was the helper, wasn’t it?
193	It was finally yellow cedar.
194	That is why even till today
195	when Killer Whale
196	fat is put in a f1ame
197	the crackling of it is just like yellow cedar.
198	This one is true,
199	this story.
200	This is not a story without value.
201	We have our names.
202	From them there are many people.
203	Even till today.
204	Even till today.
205	They were the ones who carved
206	Killer Whales.
207	It was Naatsilanéi who carved them.
208	At one point people heard
209	“There they are.
210	There they are.”
211	For whatever he needed
212	he would send out the Killer Whales.
213	There was a crad;e for them like cradles for boats.
214	That’s how he instructed
215	the Killer Whales.
216	He would tell them
217	to get on their cradies.
218	“This is what I want,”
219	is what he would say.
220	“Halibut,
221	what else,
222	seal.”
223	That’s why Killer Whale is the killer of seals
224	till today.
225	At one point its turn came.
226	“Yes.
{Page = 135}
227	It’s right there already,
228	it’s right there.
229	That’s when he told them,
230	those things he had carved,
231	“Be brave.
232	But the younger one,
233	please don’t do anything
234	to the younger one,”
235	he said.
236	At one point
237	he heard “There they are!
238	Go!
239	Go fight them!
240	Be brave!
241	But please save that younger one,”
242	he said.
243	The younger one had cried for him
244	on the island
245	when they left without him.
246	That’s why.
247	Just like that, the boat was no more.
248	The killer whales
249	cracked it in half.
250	But the younger one was pushed onto a half of the boat.
251	They swam it to the beach with him.
252	They swam it to the beach.
253	Because he cried for him.
254	People know the Killer Whale song.
255	It is valued.
256	It’s the one from our side but the strands surfaced over there from Taku.
257	It is the same song for Killer Whale,
258	“Drifted ashore Killer Whale”
259	are the words to it.
260	Yes.
261	Everybody knows this.
262	This is why those things
263	can hear people.
264	The Killer Whale
265	can hear people.
266	They can sit on land.
{Page = 137}
267	Even till today
268	it’s called “Killer Whale” by the Whitemen.
269	But we have a name for the other ene.
270	It didn”t have a dorsal fin.
271	It really didn’t have a dorsal fin.
272	It is surely the real leader isn’t it?
273	It was he
274	who was the meanest one among them.
275	Their names....?
276	This story was told too long ago.
277	Yes; we weren’t in it.
278	But our ancestors used to tell it,
279	because they were their outer containers.
280	We only know some of them.
281	This is too ancient
282	of a story.
283	It is called Deikeelunáak.
284	That fort
285	is outside of Klawock.
286	Out there
287	is an island.
288	That island lies way out.
289	It was on it that this happened.
