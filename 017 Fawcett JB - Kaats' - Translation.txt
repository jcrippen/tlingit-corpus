1	This is a magnificent story.
2	Many kinds of things happened.
3	Even from long ago
4	Tlingits
5	used to go hunting
6	in the forest
7	and harvesting on the sea.
8	“What did they hunt with?”
9	is what
10	some people ask.
11	How many years have passed.
12	Surely there used to be weapons to hunt with.
13	Tlingits
14	knew
15	how to hunt things,
16	those sea mammals too,
17	and how to catch
18	those animals that walked,
19	how to harvest
20	those on the sea
21	and those that walked inland.
22	There was a man
23	who went out hunting
24	with a dog.
25	Those great inland animals,
{Page = 221}
26	large animals,
27	were taken from their den.
28	They were taken with the use of dogs,
29	with the use of dogs.
30	That’s when
31	they came to its entrance.
32	The man
33	had a wife,
34	he had a wife.
35	Why was it?
36	After trying for a while
37	he stepped into a dangerous place.
38	It was the animal called brown bear.
39	Over here is where it happened,
40	it happened on the near side of Ketchikan.
41	It was inland.
42	Yees G̱eey is what Tlingits call the place,
43	but the White People call it Yes Bay.
44	That’s where this happened.
45	There is a river there too, a large river.
46	Now,
47	at what point was it?
48	While he was trying,
49	while he was still trying,
50	it grabbed him.
51	it was while he was aiming at it.
52	He got right up to the entrance
53	of its den.
54	The animal
55	jumped out.
56	it tossed him inside.
57	Its mate was probably in there all along,
58	that female brown bear.
59	She was inside.
60	He grabbed her private parts.
61	She looked like a woman to him.
62	As he grabbed her
63	Kaatsʼ
64	said
65	“Hey, why don't you help me?”
66	While her mate was still confused outside
67	he was searching all over.
68	While he was searching
{Page = 223}
69	for those dogs of his,
70	his dogs,
71	she buried him.
72	That’s why there's a saying
73	“underneath
74	the thing they sit on.”
75	Spruce boughs are their beds, the beds of those animais.
76	She lay face down.
77	After a while
78	the male bear came in.
79	It was a house,
80	it was a house
81	in Kaatsʼ eyes
82	although it was the den, wasn’t it?
83	“Where is the human I threw in here?”
84	the animal said.
85	“It was a mitten, here it is.
86	It was a mitten, here it is.
87	That’s what you threw in here.
88	Here it is.”
89	She put her paws over her husband’s eyes.
90	She felt something for Kaatsʼ
91	when he touched her,
92	the female bear,
93	she felt something for him.
94	She didn’t want to tell on him.
95	She put her paws over her husband’s eyes.
96	Kaatsʼ didn't know what he was going to do.
97	The male bear
98	would go out.
99	That’s when she would instruct him.
100	“Nothing will happen to you.
101	Nothing will happen to you.”
102	At one point, the moment came.
103	In Kaatsʼ eyes though,
104	for him,
105	one month was a night,
106	here it was a month all the while.
107	But Kaatsʼ
108	was gone.
109	He was no more.
110	He had an accident.
{Page = 225}
111	He was no more.
112	They didn’t know where he was.
113	They would search.
114	Of his younger brothers
115	the very youngest one
116	had a wife.
117	The youngest
118	had a wife as young as he.
119	His older brother
120	was a master hunter.
121	They would say, “Why doesn’t this one
122	find his older brother?”
123	People were suspicious,
124	his footprints were seen
125	yes,
126	alongside the bear footprints
127	they went up alongside the river.
128	Why
129	were this man’s footprints
130	going up alongside the brown bear’s?
131	That’s when people became suspicious,
132	“Perhaps he was taken by something,”
133	is what people said.
134	Noble people said this.
135	Please excuse this.
136	This is a true story,
137	this is a true story.
138	This is how it’s known,
139	this is
140	from his lips.
141	The bear would feel the approach
142	of the dogs.
143	In the den they seem like sunbeams.
144	They would shine in,
145	into the den.
146	The dogs’ thoughts
147	seem like sunbeams;
148	the woman
149	would jump up to reach for them.
150	They couldn’t find him.
151	Where was he?
152	People searched everywhere
{Page = 227}
153	But the younger brother
154	wasn’t saying anything.
155	“Why not him?” they were saying.
156	Ris footprints were seen.
157	“Why can’t he
158	find his older brother?”
159	is what the older brothers said
160	about their younger brother.
161	His wife
162	was an old woman.
163	At one point the moment came.
164	His dogs,
165	“At X̱’éeshi Gwálaa”
166	is the name of one of his dogs.
167	The other was “Shaayeesxwáa.”
168	But I forget
169	the other one.
170	Three dogs,
171	first class,
172	Shaayeesxwáa.
173	Then
174	at one point the younger brother asked his wife,
175	“Can you get my shoes ready,
176	my shoes,
177	I’ll go
178	to search.”
179	But he was the one who would find his older brother, wasn’t he?
180	But the angry men were becoming quarrelsome.
181	At one point the female bear said,
182	“I see.
183	Do you see?
184	Do You see?”
185	She told him to look there.
186	She would jump up to grab them,
187	she would jump up to grab them again.
188	No,
189	it wasn’t slowing down,
190	while she was still doing this they tracked to the entrance.
191	That’s why bears today,
192	in bear dens, you know,
193	these noble children make four barriers
{Page=229}
194	one after the other
195	on the inside.
196	Because of what happened
197	they make barriers,
198	because of what happened
199	it’s this way today.
200	But at that time
201	he reached there,
202	those dogs tracked right to the entrance while she was still doing this.
203	They pointed their noses to the mouth of the den.
204	He recognized his dogs.
205	“My dogs!”
206	he said,
207	“Be brave,”
208	he said to them.
209	“Be brave.”
210	He didn’t know what he was going to do.
211	There were no guns.
212	Those things
213	were bow and arrow.
214	They were more powerful than guns.
215	I saw some.
216	See, they were this long.
217	Strange looking.
218	The bow was curved right here, and strung with hide,
219	it was strong.
220	But the points were this long.
221	Bones.
222	They were round like eggs; they were inserted into the end of the point.
223	It detaches itself.
224	It attaches itself inside the target.
225	It was just like a bullet.
226	That’s how Tlingits killed things.
227	While he was still
228	trying to get ready (Slap!)
229	Kaatsʼ didn’t know what he was going to do.
230	I knew the brother’s name.
231	When I get mixed up,
232	it’s difficult.
233	It’s really difficult, my good woman.
{Page = 231}
234	Sometime
235	when I think of it, we’ll put it down on paper.
236	You have a good mind.
237	Good.
238	Now.
{Comment = Line 240 follows a blank line that is apparently numbered 239, omitted here.}
240	Then
241	Kaatsʼ said
242	to Shaayeesxwáa,
243	“If only you’d stop barking.”
244	He stared at his older brother.
245	Kaatsʼ recognized the other dog too.
246	“Stop barking now!”
247	He looked out of the mouth of the den,
248	why, that was his younger brother,
249	he stared at him.
250	“I’m all right,
251	it’s me,
252	teIl him to stop barking.”
253	He stared at his older brother.
254	“Here I am!
255	Here I am!”
256	He had been gone for one year, you see.
257	It was he who found his older brother.
258	“Please don’t tell this,
259	don’t tell,
260	come back again.
261	Come back.”
262	He asked him to get what he needed,
263	whatever he needed
264	from the coast.
265	“Don’t tell.”
266	The dogs ran on home.
267	Why?
268	The dogs had gone with them many times before.
269	They were so happy
270	yo-ho-ho-ho
271	they’d jump up on their hind legs.
272	People could see them.
273	The dogs were so happy
274	people got suspicious
275	and said, “Why are these dogs so happy?”
{Page = 233}
276	He had nothing to say.
277	He told his wife, you see,
278	“I saw my older brother.
279	He instructed me.
280	Be brave,”
281	he said to his wife
282	“He will come.
283	The time will come.”
284	They had a messenger.
285	They have been around for a long time.
286	You know what a messenger is.
287	Kaatsʼ was yearning
288	to go hunting
289	for seals,
290	he wanted to get his hands on seals.
291	This is what he instructed his younger brother.
292	The boat too,
293	his boat.
294	“We will go by boat.
295	There it is.”
296	Kaatsʼ showed him to where he was coming down; it’s still there today.
297	The Teiḵweidí people down south,
298	see, they told us about it.
299	“There’s where the brown bear saved a person; there it is; here it is,”
300	Ketchikan is there.
301	Also this place
302	called Yes Bay.
303	It’s called Yees G̱eey; there’s a large river,
304	the tributary that joins it this way
305	is here.
306	X̱ʼaxʼáan and his group were the ones who told us.
307	They are the Teiḵweidí whom this happened to.
308	That’s where their ancestor became a thing of value.
309	We seined there.
310	Now,
311	this is where they hunted,
312	they hunted,
313	where they paddled,
314	his children were one winter old.
315	There were three of them,
