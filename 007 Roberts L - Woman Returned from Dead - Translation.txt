1 	Long ago one man sister died. Very many
2 	days that time-from then that man however
3 	only his own company-in sadly wailed.
4 	Even not his mind from it had moved when
5 	camp-to they went. One night just alone
6 	by himself miserably was crying when his sister
7 	them toward into house brought along even
8 	while living as their mouths-for she used to bring
9 	thus. So then her brother him she told: still
10	near you because I am, your crying also
11	I hear always. Their mouths-at fully things
12	she had fed when again them from she went.
13	Several times thus their mouths-to she had given
14	when that man however his wife thread
15	to spin it told her. Completely
16	it she had spun when, her husband said
17	his sister they would track. Like that it was:
18	again their mouths-to she attended, that thread
19	thing worn by her small marten skin tail-of
20	to its end it he tied. Them from she went
21	when, as she walked thus that thread however
22	they it by hand reeled off. Then its end being
23	near to a stop it came. Day it was when
24	they it traced. His sister dead body ashes-of
25	inside reposing carved pole-to they it
26	traced. Just as there it had been put thus
27	that small marten fur its outside covered.
28	Its tail-to however that the thread by end was
29	tied. Next night that just before it like their
30	mouths-to she brought. Their mouths-at fully
31	things she had fed when them to she spoke:
32	So you know where from here I came. Not again
33	hither I shall come. Accordingly not again their
34	vicinity-to came.
