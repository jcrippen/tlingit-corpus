1	You are my little grandchild.
2	Thatʼs why itʼs okay for you to write what I say.
3	But Iʼm not very good at it.
4	I used to only listen to the talk,
5	the stories.
6	I only know what I listened to then.
7	I donʼt tell stories to people.
8	Iʼm going to tell this for the first time.
9	Itʼs the first one, Raven and Deer.
10	People tell it a little differently;
11	I will tell it
12	the way I know it.
13	Only a different way,
14	mine is just a little bit different.
15	The storytellers ahead of me
16	told it well,
17	this Deer and Raven.
18	They are each very good.
19	But they tell it differently.
20	Itʼs okay as long as it sounds right.
{Page = 2}
21	Thatʼs the way.
22	And now I will tell it.
23	Hopefully it wonʼt be mistaken.
24	Along the beach he walked, Raven.
25	People always tell it with him walking along the beach.
26	It was clear when I was small,
27	that he was walking along the beach, Raven.
28	Then he came upon that Deer.
29	It was Deer that he came upon.
30	Fat was just hanging down here.
31	“Hey my buddy” he said to him, that Raven did,
32	“your snot is just hanging down there.”
33	So he took them and gulped them right away.
34	He was really greedy, Raven.
35	You can see that where groceries are sold.
36	Theyʼre all flying around for food.
37	He swallowed its snot,
38	but it was actually fat.
39	Then he started to walk again.
40	Then he thought,
41	“That deer really has some fat.
42	Let me entice him first.”
43	So he enticed him.
44	This tree
45	was lying across this ravine, a tree.
46	“Letʼs go across the tree to the other side.”
{Page = 3}
47	He wanted to go across.
48	He wanted to get on the other side.
49	He wanted to lead him there.
50	But he knew it was rotten wood,
51	that tree.
52	They usually call it ʼrotten woodʼ.
53	An old tree,
54	itʼs punky.
55	He wants him to go over it.
56	“Nothing will happen to you, my friend” heʼs saying.
57	Heʼs calling him ʼmy friendʼ.
58	So,
59	“I will cross over before you.”
60	So then
61	heʼs walking over it.
62	That crevice, though,
63	itʼs a long way down there.
64	Itʼs lying over it,
65	that rotten wood.
66	Heʼs instructing him there
67	“Thatʼs how youʼll cross over, my friend.”
68	“Just watch me, you fart!” he said then.
69	“Just watch me, you fart! Just watch me, you fart!”
70	When heʼs walking over it, ahead of him, heʼs kind of flying.
71	Ahead of him,
72	while heʼs going along on it,
{Page = 4}
73	heʼs just flying along.
74	His full weight was not really on that rotten wood.
75	Then
76	he went across to the other side
77	and also came back.
78	He came back across it.
79	Heʼs still flying ahead of him
80	across that tree.
81	When heʼs done going across, he tells his friend
82	“Try it, my buddy.
83	Weʼll just go right over there,
84	weʼll just go along over to that place.”
85	And him,
86	he crossed over again.
87	When he gets across, he eggs him on again,
88	“Cross over now, my buddy!
89	Itʼs not difficult, cross over!”
90	And then he too steps up onto it, that deer.
91	As heʼs walking across it, it broke with him,
92	that rotten tree.
93	When it broke with him he fell down
94	to the bottom of that ravine.
95	It was at the bottom of that ravine that he died,
96	that Deer.
97	So
{Page = 5}
98	he went down by it.
99	“My dear fart!” heʼs crying for him.
100	“My dear fart!
101	My dear fart!
102	My fart, where ever should I eat you through?
103	Through where should I eat you?”
104	Well
105	just through its anus isnʼt difficult.
106	He ate it through its anus.
107	He ate it up.
108	Here heʼs crying for his fart.
109	Thatʼs what he calls him, ‘my fartʼ.
110	So
111	he ate it up.
112	Thatʼs the way I know it.
