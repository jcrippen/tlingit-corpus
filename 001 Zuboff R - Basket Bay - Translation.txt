1	That land of ours,
2	that land of ours
3	is called Ḵakʼw;
4	but in English
5	Basket Bay.
6	You know, they used to club seals,
7	at that place.
8	That place is kind of strange.
9	When the tide was almost out
10	they would send
11	one man as guard.
12	People would keep
13	a watch on the tide.
14	They would go underneath the village
15	in a grotto, by the light of sapwood,
16	underneath the village.
17	Down the bay from Shark’s Cave,
{Page = 65}
18	to the head north of Kaaḵáakw,
19	to the head north of this they would cross over
20	to go under the village.
21	A ladder was adzed there
22	a huge one;
23	it was a tree.
24	This is what was made into a ladder.
25	This is what they came down on to go underneath the village.
26	Sapwood torches were held; they would be lighted.
27	By the light of this they clubbed seals,
28	underneath the village.
29	Many different kinds of animals would gather down there.
30	And you know, there would be tide watchers.
31	One would stand out on the beach.
32	One would sit on the top of a house.
33	The third one would stand at the arch of Kaaḵáakw;
34	the fourth one
35	would stand right at the mouth of the hole.
36	As soon as the tide started corning up
37	he would cry out,
38	“The tiiiiiide is starting uuuuuuup.”
39	As if it were put in his mouth
40	the one sitting on top of the house repeated
41	“The tiiiiiide is starting uuuuuuuup.”
42	This was how they passed the word.
43	The very last man
44	would thrust his head down the hole with the words,
45	“The tiiiiiide is starting uuuuuuuup.”
46	Accordingly,
47	men would pull up the seal stomachs
48	through the throats
49	of their kills.
50	They would blow them up through the throat.
51	They tied them off;
52	they tied them off;
53	they tied them off.
54	The tide comes in under us very quickly,
55	like filling a container to the brim is how quick it is.
56	It’s like cutting off any escape
57	under us.
{Page = 67}
58	They would work very hard,
59	on this kill of theirs.
60	No sooner would they finish the last one than they would run
61	quickly;
62	they would run up the ladder in the dark;
63	only by the light of the sapwood would they run up.
64	They would even go home from their kill.
65	When the tide was finally nearly up,
66	when the tide was nearly up,
67	was when out from the village, in the bay,
68	in front of Spring Water Point
69	their kills would pop up out of the water.
70	You know, this is the way it was.
71	Then they would just get them by boat.
72	This is how the history is told,
73	about
74	Basket Bay, from the time it’s been ours,
75	from the time it’s been ours,
76	ages.
77	It was long ago,
78	it’s been long,
79	since the histories have been told of us;
80	we are named for it,
81	Ḵákʼweidí.
82	For the things that happened
83	to the Tlingits
84	in the beginning,
85	many say
86	we migrated here
87	through the south,
88	the south.
89	And, you know, there are many who migrated down the Stikine River,
90	down the Stikine River.
91	The story of my fathers is always told,
92	of when they migrated down the Stikine.
93	At one place, there,
94	in the river,
95	the river flowed under a glacier.
96	This is where they tied a raft together.
97	They put the elderly women on it.
98	One’s name was Awastí and the other Ḵoowasíkx̱,
99	these elderly women.
100	They are the first ones who were pushed under the glacier.
101	Having drifted under it and through to the other side,
102	they started singing.
103	Floating under the glacier
104	gave them their song.
105	Based on this
106	a raft was made.
107	Some went on it.
108	Under it, under the glacier, they floated,
109	down the river.
110	But many of them
111	were afraid
112	to float under the glacier.
113	This is why they started over it,
114	some started over the glacier.
115	These are the ones who came down the Chilkat, the relatives of my fathers,
116	the Daḵlʼaweidí.
117	They became the Chilkats.
118	The name that came from those who went over the glacier
119	is Sitʼká indeed,
120	those who came down through Chilkat,
121	are named Sitʼká.
122	Those of us
123	who are Deisheetaan,
124	still
125	tell it like this,
126	as coming from the South,
127	from the south.
128	I wonder where we came out, those of us.
129	I wonder where we came out.
130	From there we finally went northward,
131	northward,
132	we began searching.
133	They tried many places.
134	Villages were founded in many places.
135	At that time
136	across from Brown Bear Fort,
137	when it froze,
138	they walked over ice
139	at that time,
140	at the point when they moved across.
141	Well! There are many who are our relatives,
142	these Deisheetaan,
143	some are living in the Interior.
144	Since long ago,
145	they have been living there.
146	They are many,
147	Nahóowu lives there
148	and this namesake of mine.
149	Shaadaaxʼ is also there,
150	in the Interior.
151	You know, thinking about them,
152	if they’ve been living there a long time,
153	maybe we separated and migrated from them.
154	This is what I’m thinking about them.
155	This is why we
156	gathered here on the coast.
157	This is where I will end
158	this story.
