1	One young man long ago
2	died. Three days after that
3	back came. To people that told
4	place that had gone to and
{Page = 171}
5 	how that had happened. That time
6 	when some one died his-outside-to
7 	songs sing and his body-to also
8 	drum beat they would three days
9 	through. That young man that
10	told: then when dead,
11	his body-of inside from he came.
12	His body-to crying ones among
13	he walked and their minds-from also
14	seemingly something cleared. His coffin-of
15	inside-at his body was laid when,
16	songs they sang; and that house
17	side-place door his front-side-from
18	opened. Out of house outside
19	had gone when, then road wide one
20	upon looked. After that then
21	the road upon he went. Just
22	place-from that the thing song
23	one heard that road not
24	there anything was, but just wherefrom
25	that quite it ended then therefrom
26	the road its-end would appear and
27	thicket inside he would walk. Just
28	wherefrom that they began to sing
29	that before him road would appear
30	and again begin walking would. So
31	long had walked when, lake
32	shore-along went. The
33	across from him people seeing
34	when, to them waved and canoe also
35	requested. Just so under him canoe
36	came and so across ashore
{Page = 172}
37	was taken. There then
38	known woman her he saw.
39	With her that speaking when, thus
40	to him said: back go yet time
41	you have while. Here hard-like us
42	they make work that surely
43	peopleʼs place-at however even more
44	than here for them there
45	they make hard. Then thus to him
46	that told that aboard ashore
47	they had taken canoe that lake
48	bottom-on sunk log really had been.
49	The womanʼs talk-to listened,
50	accordingly her-talk-after
51	his mind changed, and her he asked
52	how back he would get. To him
53	that told how that thence
54	flowing creek it he would find and
55	how entirely it he might tell
56	which way it flowed. There then
57	fully him she informed at what time
58	not him one would trace. Just so
59	there from shore him took across:
60	not them one saw. Thus
61	walking along when, that water upon
62	he came. Just as to him
63	it she had told so that found.
64	Slowly flowed that creek.
65	All this time the dead oneʼs
66	body-to beating time along there
67	they sang. Just when that sound
68	end reached then that road end-to
{Page = 173}
69	he would get and thicket into
70	would walk. Likewise then about it
71	would forget whither it flowed that
72	creek. As him she had informed
73	exactly as, then water-in
74	face would put at first thing
75	of singing. Thereby again
76	he would know whither it flowed
77 	and whither goal-to its front-to
78 	he should move. Very truly strongly
79 	thus fully that him she had told often:
80 	however this there happens then
81 	don’t hither back you come ever.
82 	Accordingly even though it was hard
83 	not therefore went there. Just
84 	along walking while, child to him
85 	came and just himself-with
86 	it he took. As there they walked
87 	when, their town-to back they
88 	came. House-to he had taken
89 	when, home he went. Home came
90 	when, right there still over him
91 	crying they were and going
92 	his body-to inside he got. Yet
93 	pityful-like wailing there was while,
94 	men-among head raised. Then that
95 	to them it he told where that
96 	he had gone and how that
97 	had happened. Arising-after not
98 	long that there news
99 	one brought: before that day
100	having died child back had come.
